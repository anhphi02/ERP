This repository contains notes on various topics related to operations management and inventory control. 

The notes cover how to use Excel Solver and QM for Windows to solve optimization problems related to transportation and inventory management. 

The topics covered include transportation problems, variations of transportation problems, cost components of inventory models, and variations of the basic economic order quantity (EOQ) model in inventory management. 

Specific examples of EOQ model variations covered include the EOQ model with planned shortages (ACT Co.), the EOQ model with quantity discounts (ACT Co.), and the EOQ model with gradual replenishment (SOCA). 

These tools can be used to solve complex problems involving multiple variables and constraints, making them valuable resources for individuals studying operations management, supply chain management, or inventory control.
